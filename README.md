# Raspberry Pi DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Monitoring

This project uses a Raspberry Pi and a DHT11 sensor to monitor temperature and humidity. It includes two scripts:
- `dth.py`: Reads temperature and humidity from the DHT11 sensor and prints the values to the console.
- `dthmail.py`: Sends an email alert when the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following hardware and software:
- Raspberry Pi with Python 3 installed
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- Internet connection for email alerts (for `dthmail.py`)

## Installation

1. **Update Your Raspberry Pi**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

2. **Install Required System Package**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libgpiod2
   ```

3. **Install Required Python Packages**:
   Use the following commands to install the necessary Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip3 install adafruit-blinka
   pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-dht
   pip3 install setuptools
   ```

4. **Enable GPIO and I2C**:
   - Run the Raspberry Pi Configuration Tool:
     ```bash
     sudo raspi-config
     ```
   - Go to **Interfacing Options** and enable **I2C** and **GPIO**.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Run the Scripts**:
   - To print temperature and humidity to the console:
     ```bash
     python3 dth.py
     ```
   - To monitor temperature and send email alerts:
     ```bash
     python3 dthmail.py
     ```

## Configuration

- **Temperature Threshold**: You can set the temperature threshold for alerts in `dthmail.py`:
  ```python
  TEMP_THRESHOLD = 28  # Change to your desired value
  ```

- **Email Settings**:
  - Update the `send_email` function in `dthmail.py` with your sender email, recipient email, and app password:
    ```python
    sender_email = "your-email@gmail.com"
    receiver_email = "recipient-email@example.com"
    password = "your-app-password"
    ```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors, ensure all packages are correctly installed, and the GPIO/I2C interfaces are enabled.
- Use `python3` for running the scripts to ensure compatibility.
